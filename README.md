# neurie - Neural Network
The goal of the project 'neurie' is the creation of a **fully functioning, simple, adjustable and efficient neural network**. The neural network is learning with **[backpropagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation)** and uses the **[sigmoid-function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function)** to keep the neuron activations in the range of 0 to 1. Because of its great adaptability, 'neurie' can be used for any type of AI-required task within other projects. Java is not known for a good efficiency, but it is able to clearly display the structure of a neural network in **only 4 different classes**.
